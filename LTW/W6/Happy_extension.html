<!-- At the start, Tbakew was not very active, but he is active when it matters the most, so no complaints. He know how to do naval (which tbh i'm not all that good at), and with his help we turn the tide on them and wipe out their navy. 

Tommy will need improvement on the grand scale of strategy, macro so to speak. You underestimate the enemy at the start and had too small a naval force for a main player in that role. Your research was too spread out with minimal effectiveness, across all of naval mrl. All in all, good performance but minor improvements is needed.

Human was mainly ground force and air, but same as tommy, your research was a bit off point at the start, going for too much ground and armoured. But you acted as a deterrence for the eu front so it's alright. As for airforce, you would need more strikers to be effective, especially when the other air player already have too much asf and also is doing some questionable things with helis (me)

As for myself, I should not have been playing around with helis and mrl when the match is not yet a guaranteed victory.(But early heli gunship rush is very good i'll give them that)

In general, our team was too bogged down in america, even with 4 players attacking, and improvement on speed is needed. All player have various online period but when there is an serious threat everyone is active. Other than that, good performance on all member. -->
